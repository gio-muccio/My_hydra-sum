# My commented "Hydrasum" as a baseline and utility for MoE  
Original repository of hydra-sum: https://github.com/salesforce/hydra-sum  

In the Hydra-sum model, a gating mechanism is employed. This mechanism serves as a baseline and utility as it will be updated to adhere to the latest MoE (Mixture of Experts) rules.  
Therefore, this repository contains an initial commented version of the hydra-sum model code.
